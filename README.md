# Workshop: Azure Custom Vision - Find the Right Tool

## Session Information

**Session Duration:**   
120 minutes
 
**Session Title:**   
Create an application that can see - using Microsoft Cognitive Services

**Session Abstract:**  
In this workshop you will be introduced to the [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=gaic-github-cxa), a range of offerings you can use to infuse intelligence and machine learning into your applications without needing to build the code from scratch.
We will cover pre-trained AI APIs, such as [computer vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/?WT.mc_id=gaic-github-cxa), that are accessed by REST protocol. Next we will dive into Custom AI that uses transfer learning - [Microsoft Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/?WT.mc_id=gaic-github-cxa). This enables you to provide a small amount of your own data to train an image classification model. Wrapping the workshop up by building our custom trained AI into an application - using [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=gaic-github-cxa), this technology is ideal for building data pipeline processes that work with your machine learning models.

**Pre-requisites**   
* Azure Pass or [Microsoft Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/?WT.mc_id=gaic-github-cxa)
* Laptop with a modern web browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
* Postman, API Development Environment - [available on Windows, Linux and macOS](https://www.getpostman.com/)

> *All demos and content have been tested on a Windows PC, however all options should run from macOS and Linux machines as well. Please provide information via an issue or pull request if you have feedback on other operating systems*
